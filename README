% Calculate the sum over all graphs of order 5 of the colouring numbers of
% colourings with inorder vertex ordering.

The first function we need is one that gives the path to the folder given
an integer order.

We also need an array with numbers of graphs of a given order. Or another
function that derives it from the number of files in a folder.

% A function of the order which appears explicitly in the path and implicitly
% in the range top end value (presumably stored in an array somewhere).
for n in {0..33};\
   do\
     ccli greedy --type=simple --ordering=inorder /home/matthew/workspace/graphs-collection/src/Small/5/$n.dimacs;\
   done

% Also a function of order which appears in the path. This function should
% return the number of colours used over all graphs of that order.
sed -n 's/CLRS \([0-9]*\) [A-Z a-z = 0-9 .]*/\1/p' /home/matthew/workspace/graphs-collection/src/Small/5/*.dimacs.res\
   | paste -s -d"+"\
   | bc

% Don't forget to clean up after the calculations have been made.
rm /home/matthew/workspace/graphs-collection/src/Small/5/*.dimacs.res

These steps now need to be embedded in a loop (for n in {2..7}). For each
step in the loop we consider one folder.

Outside that loop there is yet another loop (for order in [inorder, ...]).

The result should be four files:
inorder.out
random.out
decdeg.out
incdeg.out

Each of them just being a list of 6 numbers. The colouring numbers for that
ordering on vertices over all graphs of a fixed order.

It makes sense, I think, to do all of this in Bash. The above loop should
be a function. The second command should also be a function, the output of
which is what gets put into those four output files.
